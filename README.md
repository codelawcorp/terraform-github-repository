# README

This is a reusable Terraform module for creating github repo and related configurations.

## Description 🤝

This is the most complete github repo module out there.  
It bundles all resources related to `github_repository`.

Github provider has a lot of misperceptions. If you get some API errors, try another combination of parameters. We reduced your possible hardships by including input validations.  
Do not blame Terraform or this module - this is Github's provider implementation issues.  
Nonetheless, having the opportunity to spin up new projects in seconds and control configurations in a single place is a great advantage.

## Getting started 🚀

## Development 🐙

Setup GitHub authentication

```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
gh auth setup-git
git clone <this repo>
```

### Configuring

- There are TODO comments in the code.
- Install git hooks. Run this command `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
- [Configure GPG keys if required](doc/GPG-KEYS.md)

### Building 🧱

### Deploying 🏋🏼

### Branching strategy 🚨

- Branches are named after environments.
- Number of environments `==` number of branches. E.g. for `prod`, `stg`, `dev` environments, you should have `prod`, `stg`, `dev` branches respectively.
- The default branch should be `prod`, not `master`/`main`.
- Do development on `dev` branch. Propagate changes from `dev` -> `stg` -> `prod` branches. CI/CD will deploy to respective environments upon merging. Merging is a deployment trigger.
  Also recommended:
- Do not protect `dev` branch. Do [Trunk Based Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4Ijkq6Myfc) on a `dev` branch e.g. everyone can push there. Developers collaborate by doing pull-rebase/push often. Automated tests is a must.
- Configure on-demand mini-dev per-developer so developers can experiment there, but dev should be accessible to push to integrate changes frequently.
- If a startup with no users, do everything in `prod` and `prod` branch.

With this branching strategy you are always certain which version of code is deployed to your envs.
Merging is deploying.

#### Semantic Versioning

Code is versioned according to this convention [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).  
When a new commit is pushed to the default branch (`prod`), GHA runs an npm script which determines the next version and pushes a git tag. Optionally, it generates `CHANGELOG.md`.

- To force-trigger a new version without actually making any changes, run `git commit --allow-empty -m "fix: trigger release with empty commit" && git push`
